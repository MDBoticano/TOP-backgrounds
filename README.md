# Backgrounds
This is my submission for The Odin Project's [Backgrounds and Gradients Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/building-with-backgrounds-and-gradients) for their HTML & CSS curriculum.

You can view the page [here](https://mdboticano.github.io/TOP-backgrounds).

## Objectives & Goals
- Practice layouts with CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Create gradients with CSS
- Compare backgrounds in HTML with `<img>` versus in CSS with the `background-image` rule
